### Microdoft Cognitive Toolkit :- CNTK ###
Overview:-
The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is an open-source toolkit for commercial-grade distributed deep learning. 
CNTK allows the user to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs/LSTMs).
CNTK implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers.
The latest release of CNTK is 2.6.
CNTK can be included as a library in your Python, C#, or C++ programs, or used as a standalone machine-learning tool through its own model description language (BrainScript). 
CNTK supports 64-bit Linux or 64-bit Windows operating systems. 
CNTK is also one of the first deep-learning toolkits to support the Open Neural Network Exchange ONNX(it is a open format to represent deep learning models) format, an open-source shared model representation for framework interoperability and shared optimization. 

Installing CNTK:-linux
required packages : sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin
pip install cntk
