###Tableue Basic Tutorials###

1. Tableau Data Science Tutorial 1 | K Means Clustering on IRIS data | Clustering algorithm

  simply find out similarities between group of data sets by ML clustering
  If we have data sets we used to cluster it in tableue
  There will be multiple clusters you can name it as per business understanding so that data will make some sense
  Also we can find out how many values are right or wrong
  It is also imp to identify how many values are right or wrong : in this we can find out accuracy of values(clusters) by calculating field(sheet).
  Also we can create dashboard to see Details like : ML Clusters,Real Values,Accuracy
 
Note : Unsupervised data set : It means we do not know anything about data set.

What we learn : what is clustering,we took the IRIS data to create a cluster to identify the 3 different species of flower

2. Tableau Data Science Tutorial 2 | K Means Clustering on Titanic data | Clustering algorithm

Titanic data : One of the very famous ML data set.

This way you can experiment the data and you can experiment the variable, create a different views and finally consolidate a view,you can create either a dashboard or may be a story to basially drag your sheet and try to create a story based on your observations what are the variables that are really contributing to identify the good clusters what are those clusters.

3. How To create Linear Regression Model in Tableau : Boston housing data set

Tableue internal machine algos
Linear Regression - The Objective of Linear Regression is to fit the best line by minimizing the errors.

The idea behind LR is that the two variables of our interests for which we want to do the predictions they should be linearly corelated.

We will learn how to create straigh forward linear line in Tableue.

4. Exercise for creating Linear Regression Model in Tableau

Tableue Internal Ml Algos
Linear Regression - Excercise

5. Solution to Tableau Linear Regression Exercise

6. How to Create Correlation Matrix in Tableau 

Correlation matrix with the variables.

7. How to connect Tableau with R | Tableau R Integration examples

In this tutorial we will learn how to integrate tableue with R.

Integrating Tableue and R :

# Rserve Package in R helps establishthe connection between R and Tableue
# Tableue pass the R code via script
# R Processes the data via the live connection(that we have established,we have that Rserve Package) and return the output.

Steps: In R Frame or Tool

>library(Rserve) or go to packages and selct Rserve package(It will be loaded).

Once it is loaded need to run the function that is Rserver() - it will start the Rserve service

>Rserve()

After that just go to the tableue tool and use sample sata source which will be already default there.And then go to help->setting and performance->manage external connection :- put server:localhost port:6311 and click on test connection and then ok.

Once it is done you can start with passing the arguments,before that go through below syntax overview: 

There are four different functions(SCRIPT_BOOL,SCRIPT_INT,SCRIPT_REAL,SCRIPT_STR) one of the function we are going to use is SCRIPT_REAL(it returns the real value)

Syntax Overview: 

SCRIPT_REAL("
.arg1+.arg2
",sum(sales),sum(profit))
